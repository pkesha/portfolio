        <ul>
            <li>
                Created a Spring Boot backend application that stored information in PostgreSQL databases
            </li>
            <li>This backend will allow the client to save users who then proceed to provide their reviews on
                subjects and content of their choice
            </li>
            <li>Each user can leave a review that will fall under any particular category of the users choosing.

            </li>
            <li>In consideration of the user experience, users will only be able to use a First and Last name and
                not a custom defined user name. This will provide a communal experience that lends itself towards
                a sense of community
